```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)

library(here)
```


In a code chunk below, the ces3demographics.csv data will be read in as object **ces** using a relative file path with the here()

```{r}
ces <- read.csv(here("data", "ces3demographics.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() #The ces data is modified with the clean_names() so column names are in lower snake case
```

Here I will make a scatterplot of CalEnviroScreen pollution burden score vs % white
```{r}
ggplot(data = ces, aes(x= white, y = ces_3_0_score)) +
  geom_hex() +
  labs(x = "Percentage of Population Identifiying as White", y = "CES 3.0 Score")
  
```
